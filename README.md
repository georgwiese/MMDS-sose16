# MMDS-sose16

As part of the "Mining Massive Datasets" Seminar of the [HPI](http://hpi.de/), this project implements a prediction system for taxi pickups in New York City.
We used the [TLC Trip Record Data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml), as well as weather and event datasets, to train regression models using [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

In this document, we will describe the datasets we used, our implementation, and our results.
