# Evaluation

For evaluation, we evaluate on the 2015 data and on the 25 districts specified in `districts.txt`.
The districts have been chosen by sampling uniformly amoung the top 200 districts in terms of counts.
The overall pickup counts in these districts range from 45k to 62k.

The files `districts_1.txt` and `districts_10.txt` contain only the first and the top 10 districts instead of all 25 districts found in `districts.txt`.
